/* Write a program called search_and_replace that takes 3 arguments, the first
arguments is a string in which to replace a letter (2nd argument) by
another one (3rd argument).
If the number of arguments is not 3, just display a newline.
If the second argument is not contained in the first one (the string)
then the program simply rewrites the string followed by a newline. */
